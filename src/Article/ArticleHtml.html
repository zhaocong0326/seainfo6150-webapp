      <h1> The Statue of Liberty's torch heads to new museum</h1>

      <p> The Statue of Liberty's original torch is getting a new home. </p>

      <p> Made of copper and gold so that it would shine bright, the first torch took a beating from the weather and was replaced by a replica <br /> in 1984. It's been stored in the statue's pedestal ever since.</p>

      <p>But visitors will be able to see the original 3,600-pound torch in all its glory at a new Statue of Liberty Museum, which will open<br /> on Liberty Island in May 2019. The torch was transported there by truck last week, along with a replica model of Lady Liberty's<br /> face.</p>

      <p>"Although it is not one of the most difficult things we have ever moved," says Douglas Phelps, who oversaw the relocation of the<br /> torch, "it is certainly the most important." </p>


      <h2>The history of the Statue of Liberty</h2>

      <p>Not only is the Statue of Liberty the symbol of New York City, she is also a UNESCO World Heritage site under the designation of<br /> _Outstanding Universal Value_.</p>

      <p>Her full name is Liberty Enlightening the World, and she was designed by Frederic Auguste Bartholdi and built by Gustave Eiffel -- <br />yes, the same guy who built Paris's Eiffel Tower.</p>

      <p>Lady Liberty was a gift from France to the United States to celebrate the centennial of their nation's independence -- although, <br /> somewhat awkwardly, she arrived a decade too late. Nevertheless, President Grover Cleveland formally unveiled her in 1886.</p>

      <p>Since then, the statue has served as a symbol of hope and possibility for many people who entered the United States as immigrants<br /> via neighboring Ellis Island.</p>

      <p> "The original torch is a beautiful object of art and exemplifies the American ideals of freedom and democracy," says John <br /> Piltzecker, superintendent of the Statue of Liberty National Monument. That symbolic spirit inspired the decision to inscribe these<br /> famous lines on the statue's pedestal:  </p>

     <blockquote>
      Give me your tired,
      your poor <br />
      Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free.
     </blockquote>

     

      <p>In 2017, nearly 4.5 million people visited Liberty Island.</p>

      <p>When completed, the Statue of Liberty Museum will be 26,000 square feet of history, inspiration and deeper analysis of the statue's<br /> symbolism both in the US and around the world.</p>

      <p>The inspiration gallery, which is where the torch will live, will have floor-to-ceiling glass windows looking out at Lower<br /> Manhattan, including the World Trade Center.</p>
